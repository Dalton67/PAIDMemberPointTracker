<h4>Exporting Memebers</h4>
<p>
    <li>One can create a backup of the member data by exporting the members table. This process can be achieved by 
    going to the members page with admin access and pressing the "Export Table" button. This will download a CSV
    file that will contain all of the member information along with their points. </li>
</p>
<h4>Importing Members</h4>
<p>
    <li>Admins can  bulk add members if needed by clicking the "Bulk Add New Members" button.
    The user can import a CSV formatted file. The file should match the format given by Marketplace 
    when pulling new member information. If a mass amount of points need to be added, an admin can 
    create a new event and import points through a CSV to be added to all of the members.</li>
</p>

<h3>Events</h3>

    <li>There are two ways to update points in bulk.</li>
    <ol>

    <li>The user can also refresh from the Evets page by clicking the "Refresh" button, refreshing the events will pull all of the new events from PAID Participation Tracker.</li>
    </ol>

</p>

<h3>Data Backup</h3>
<p>
    <li>Data does not need to be backed up frequently as the database holding all of the data is secure,
    but the data should be backed up once a month in the case the case that data is accidentally mass deleted.</li>
    <li>Data can be backed up by exporting the members table, intructions can be found in the "Exporting Members" 
    section above.</li>
    <li>If data is lost, an admin can bulk add new members and refresh the event pulled from the 
    PAID Participation Tracker and add the points to members that way.</li>
